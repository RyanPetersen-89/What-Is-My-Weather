## Project Goal


*Given the prompt below the goal of the project was to create a weather app that would dynamicaly display weather data recieved from a weather API fetch request. The app should have a functional search history to display previously searched cities for quick access. The app should display a five day forecast and have an icon displayed that reflects the current weather condition.*
<br><br>

- GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

- WHEN I search for a city

- THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

- WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city

- THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed

- WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city

- THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

- WHEN I click on a city in the search history

- THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Personal Struggles

Do to a personal situation outside of class the couple weeks leading up to tihs project were difficult for me as far as absorbing the information so I feel behind a bit at that time but I'm back in the swing of things and plan on going back to properly complete all my previous projects that I did not do my best work on.

## Proud Accomplishments

For me just this project was actually fun to figure out and play with. I think the thing that I'm most proud of is how the background changes for the todays weather section depending on the current weather condition.

Secondly my other proud accomplishment for this project is actually finishing it properly and resubmitting it, and being happy with the final product nowing I did a decent job that I can be proud of. I think it could be better styled but I can just say thats a future development thing. Functionally its solid.

<br>

## Project Outcome

As long as this gets a higher score than I originally got I'd say the final outcome is great, I'm proud of the work I did and the product runs smoothly. I believe I covered the desired functionality outlined in the challenge description to the best of my abilities without missing anything.
